# SuperMP-Public

A public test for my Supermarket Simulator Multiplayer Mod.
Use the Issues tab to report any problems you found with the mod!

My discord for questions and feedback: https://discord.gg/rtYbKZrpeY

# Known Issues
- Cashiers are not synced yet, so they will not work as intended.
- Restockers are not synced yet, so they will not work as intended.
- Loans are not synced yet, so they will not work as intended.
- Players have only a walking animation, nothing else.
- Time is not synced. I believe it shouldn't matter, as day change and store open are syned... but if any issues pop up, let me know

# How to install
- Download https://www.nexusmods.com/supermarketsimulator/mods/9 and install it. Install instructions for the mod loader are on the Nexus page.
- Download my Release.zip
- Unpack the SupermarketMultiplayer.dll into your game folder->BepinEx->plugins
- Enjoy :p

If everything worked, you should see a version number at the top left of the game.
You can start and join a Multiplayer Game over the Computer in your store.

# Will this corrupt my game file?
It should not. For people who connect, the Save file system is completely disabled.
For the host, the save file is modified as if he would play alone.
In theory this should not cause any corruption, if it does, I apologize! Let me know if anything unexpected happens.

# Disclaimer
The mod uses a custom Statistics system which **can not be turned off yet**.
I will add a opt-out before I completely release this mod.

This statistic collects: SteamID, Steam Display Name, When you started a network session, when you closed a network session and the current version of the mod.
